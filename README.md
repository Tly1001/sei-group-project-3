<a href="https://dinder-for-recipes.netlify.app/">Deployed Link<a/>

The third project is to **build a full-stack application** using **Mongoose, Express, React.JS and Node.JS**.

### Technical Requirements

Brief:

* **Time given** - 8 days.
* **Group members** - 4.
* **Create and consume an API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
* **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to your disgression and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Wireframe

<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/Y1gbyc00bHPZqZpkZwb8Jd/Dinder?node-id=0%3A1">Figma link<a/>
  
Before we started I created the overall wireframe for the pages built in ***Figma***. For this project I wanted to give a clear outline of what the end product would be, so that the instructors would have a thorough grasp of what we were trying to achieve and to save time when it came to the styling phase.

## Featured code

## Wins and Blockers

One of the challenges we faced was with promises from the backend. There were a lot async issues where pages would break due to information not being fetched in time. We managed to fix these but at the cost of a lot of time researching.

A big win personally was managing to impliment the messaging. I took it upon myself to build both the frontend and backend for it, however due to the constraints of how the backend was built from another team member I was unable to show names for the friends list to message.

## Future Features

* Functioning image upload
* Friend sidebar shows names
* Message deleting does so to both users(only works for current user so far)

## Key Lessons Learnt

Understanding how React works with props and a little bit of foresight knowing what to expect, and whether to put the state in the parent component saved a lot of time in the long run. However, some components were not built this way and took some refactoring to impliment additional features, this was a team communication issue which I will bear in mind for in the future.
